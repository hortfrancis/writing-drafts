# Desiccation of the Cybermen 

"Corridor 9 looks good."

Garrick could smell that beautiful sharp old damp smell, it lifted him up. The older the wreck, the better the catch. He always said that, and he was always right.

`"... spare ..."`

But still an atavistic shout at the back of his mind. Not quite sterile ... Dead crew? Long time for a smell like that to linger.

It really didn't matter, the scans were good. Scans being good is what matters.

`"... spare..."`

The derelict ship was drifting light years away from any trading space lane, it was properly his ... theirs, sorry ... for the taking. Scans don't lie, either. He was probably moments away from the find of his not unreasonably illustrious entrepreneurial salvage career. The rookie didn't matter, and Hando knew to listen to his old man.

`" ... parts ..."`

The door to the 'restricted' section had a reassuringly garish zigzagged pattern around its frame.

"Got a lock with a terminal by it. Hando what's the code for this?"

Garrick waited in the cold dark corridor, it's metal walls rising up metres above his opened-helmeted head. He sighed. I would have told me the code by now, he's slow.

"I think it's ... try ... seventeen zeta slash kidney"

"Kidney?"

What was this muppet on about? 

"It looks like a kidney, it's the blob, bottom right", Hando's voice squeezed it's way through the static in Garrick's helmet. It was an embarrassment once again to call him his son. 

Garrick punched in the code. Not as green as the rook at least. She was probably still back at the airlock, triple-checking her suit seals. Well, she'd soon learn soon enough that in this business risks reap rewards. Suppose it does look a bit like a kidney. 

The restricted section door with the garish zigzag tape popped open with a satisfying crunch, and some air escaped into the dead metal corridor, which had inside it only darkness sitting at both ends and the pinprick of living light that was Garrick, the captain of the salvage vessel _La Fuega_, in the middle of the deepest space there was, attached to the great hulking spectre that held, according to their scans, the biggest hoard of rare elements, quantum processors, antimatter containers, and most of it through this now opened door.

Garrick noticed himself begin to grin widely; and this time, didn't stop himself.

`"... spare ..."`, said the metallic groan that was _also_ in the corridor. 

`"... spare .... parts ...."`

Garrick's boot caught slightly on the metal door frame, it clanged. The noise echoed upwards into the darkness. It rippled through the old ship.

He poked at the darkness with the flashlight in his hand. The beam was wide but the blackness swallowed it, small glints of treasures in the cargo section echoed back as he peered deeper into this great metal cavern, this trove of wonders! 

The door behind him closed. 

**BANG**

Garrick jumped, the adrenaline met his mind like a jolt of clarity. The cold dead air felt clammy suddenly, pressing in towards him. He looked back, at the door, then around him again, at the total expanse of cargo bay, the clutter of equipment, containers, the shadows flickering around and behind them, all the trembling little shapes his flashlight made.

"Hando..."

His voice was very unsteady. He cleared his throat and tried again.

Static.

"Hando!"

Garrick could feel the cold sweat now down the back of his neck. Something made a noise a few metres to his side.

When he finally saw it striding towards him the cold fear stopped the scream in the back of his throat dead. 

* * *

The Doctor leaned into the display, his eyes squinting at the readout. He had a scrunched up expression of vague displeasure, as if expecting something not yet found.

"Why have you taken us _here_?.."

The old man stooped forwards, elbows leaning between the dials and switches on the hexagonal central console. He spoke thoughtfully.

"Just a spaceship ... looks old. Not _near_ anything..."

"A spaceship?"

Desidura's attention-piqued face poked up from behind a brown leather book above him on the metal staircase.

"Can we see the spaceship?"

The Doctor looked around, suddenly reminded that other people and/or things exist from time to time. Straightening himself up, adjusting his black frock coat collar. 

"No, it's just ... well it's probably just an old hulk. Floating out here..."

He turned back to the monitor. Peering again. 

"Don't know _why_ she brought us ..."

Desi began climbing down the staircase, towards the Doctor in the middle of the TARDIS control room, that great spherical space with its catwalks and books and bookcases (mostly very full).

"There's a distress signal; it's quite weak though. I don't think we would have tracked it from the vortex."

Desi jumped down the last few steps and the grated metal floor that held the central console clanged -- and bounced a few centimetres, to the Doctor's irritation.

"Hmm ... probably nothing very interesting." The Doctor's right hand rose over the big jutting lever on the console, instinctively, ready to leave -- a smooth, unthought motion. His hand hovered, awaiting instructions.

Desi pushed in to get a better look at the monitor hanging from a rail in the middle of the big hexagonal console. She could sort of make out a small grey blob on a dark starry background, amongst all the weird floating glyphs and foreign numerals. The view enlarged as she looked: the ship was big and angular, an awkward shoulder or an arm-shaped thing hanging in the void. It had a damaged section, bent and twisted. It looked a bit like a thrown away bone, or a half-used tool that broke.  

"Ambrose, what do you think?"

A clicking and a whirring preceded the spherical robot turning from its present task of dusting and rearranging the artefacts on a bookshelf -- made harder by the fact that there were clearly far more books than bookshelves available to house them -- and floating down towards Desi and the Doctor, folding his feather duster neatly into a hatch for future reference.

"I think, Miss Desidura", Ambrose began, his prim voice asserting an honest opinion, "that any distress signal, no matter how faint, deserves our attention. It would be most uncivil to ignore a cry for help."

The Doctor rolled his eyes. "It's probably a malfunction. Old ships _do_ tend to do that, you know."

Desi grinned, looping her arm through one of Ambrose' spindly jointed appendages. "But what if it's not? What if someone needs our help?"

The Doctor's hand still hovered over the lever, ready to leave with unanswered questions lingering in his mind. Ambrose' screen lit up helpfully with a fetching lifebuoy symbol. 

The Doctor shook his head, but his hand moved away from the lever. "We'll take a quick look", keying in coordinates for the short hop from outside the derelict to inside it. "But I'm telling you, it'll be nothing. Just an empty ship."

Desi's face was a picture of excitement. She looked from Ambrose to the Doctor and back, a big grin on her. "This is my first spaceship, Ambrose", she said, in lighthearted conspiracy.

The Doctor's expression softened somewhat. "Just ... be careful. Old ships can be dangerous, very dangerous. Ambrose, keep an eye on here." He looked Ambrose square on, a deliberate clear expression.

"Of course, sir", Ambrose agreed, his screen switching to a boyish salute emoji. "I shall guard Miss Desidura with the utmost diligence."

The Doctor checked his work on the console, then returned his hand to the lever, pulling it downwards forcefully but gently. The rotor in the centre of the room lit up, bobbed rhythmically, the lights around the outskirts of the room flickered in unison. Desi's grin grew bigger. 

The journey was short and Desi felt the bounce as the TARDIS met ground -- ground in space? What was that called, she wondered?   

The Doctor flicked more switches, still studying the square monitor, which now showed a dim, grey corridor, walls extending away to inky blackness. 

"There's air, that's good. Pressure seems fine; O2, yes ... gravity ... point nine ... well that's ok... "

He tweaked the high collar of his black frock coat, ran a hand through dishevelled, white hair, turning to the TARDIS door, then to his two companions, raising eyebrows in expectation. 

"Your first spaceship, Desi."

* * *

The corridor was grey except for the bright blue policebox; although made less bright and more grey also, by the single dim light flickering somewhere far above. The light struggled under years of unrequired entropy; it strained at the darkness around it. 

The Doctor opened the greyed blue door, poked his head out, looked from one side to the other, as far as his craning neck would let him without setting an actual foot on the metal floor of the ship itself, and then -- disappointed not to find an imminent threat deserving of a quick exit -- gingerly stepped into the derelict ship that floated in the vast dead expanse between stars and planets and any sign of life of any kind at all. 

He sniffed carefully, looked upwards and aroundwards. The corridor was quite wide, certainly enough to fit at least three TARDISes side-by-side, with some room to spare. It was grimy and industrial and did not look welcoming. The very presence of a person seemed an inconvenience to the corridor. The single light high above them blinked in an  irregular pattern, unsure it wanted to be here.  

Desi came bounding out and Ambrose floated dutifully behind. Desi was very excited. 

"It's ... "

Desi looked around. 

"It's ... Do all spaceships look like this?"

Desi looked slightly less excited. An interstellar tour of stains on walls wasn't what she'd hoped for. 

"It's a working ship. Well not a _working_ ship, it's very old. But it clearly had a job."

The Doctor was still glancing up and down. His eyes were drawn to the darkness at the end of the corridor now. 

"Hello!", he shouted. 

'Hello' shouted back, an eery echo of his own voice made cold and metallic by the ship's sterile surfaces. It lingered for longer than made Desi comfortable. She felt a shiver up her back from the bottom of her spine to the top of her scalp. 

"Hello, we're visiting. Anyone home?"

The Doctor, out front a few paces, just short of the inky gloom, turned towards Desi and shrugged. 

Desi noticed the smell. It was faint, but it smelled like ... 

"Ambrose, do you possess a light?"

The spherical robot butler bobbed forwards, towards the slightly murky figure of the Doctor, which lit up suddenly as Ambrose threw a beam out in front of him. The Doctor put a hand up to his face, shielding his eyes. On the floor in front his silhoeutte cast an elongated Nosferatu of a shadow. 

"Take the lead, Ambrose". The Doctor's voice was cool and calm, but there was no excited undercurrent now. Desi felt small and vulnerable in the big corridor, and looked back nervously at the TARDIS. The door was closed. She shivered again. 

"Where's the distress signal coming from?" the Doctor asked the floating robot, as it shone a path forwards. More corridor, some crates and broken equipment lying in irregular arrangements further ahead. Ambrose paused for a moment, spun gently on his axis, whurring audibly in the otherwise silence of the ship. "I believe, this direction, sir." 

Even Ambrose sounded slightly subdued in his echoing corridor voice, thought Desi.   

I glint of light reflected ahead of them. It moved. The Doctor strained his vision, peered into the darkness. 

**CLANG**

From Desi's left came sudden footsteps. 

Two figures burst into the corridor, flashlight beams swinging around wildly. Desi drew her arm up against the glare, taking a few steps back. Something on the floor behind her caught her foot, she fell backwards. 

"Who are you!?"

A man in a startled voice yelled. Desi's behind hurt from the fall. She sat up, the light blinded her again. 

"Hello", said a friendly, kindly voice. The voice of an elderly neighour. "Hello, I'm the Doctor."

"What are you doing here?" The first voice was a panic at being caught doing something wrong. 

"We're being blinded by very bright lights", said the jovial old neighbour, a wry tone. Just after a cup of sugar, the tone winked. 

The bright white torchbeams dropped downwards. Desi could make out the two figures on the end of them now. Both in spacesuits; one taller than the other -- a bit wider than the other, too. In one hand the flashlight, in the other hand ... She couldn't make it out, but the taller one was brandishing his towards the Doctor. The shorter figure looked embarassed. 

"Hando, I don't think they're dangerous", said a young female voice. "She's a kid and he's an old man." The voice was reasonable and informal, but not confident. 

"Don't tell them our _names_", said the voice that was called Hando. 

"I'm the Doctor, this is Desi, and this is Ambrose. We heard a distress signal, very faint. Was that you?"

The spacesuit pair were silent, awkwardly glancing at each other. The man had a thick jaw, small dark eyes, jet black hair. Stubble around the chin, a tired expression, bags under eyes. The woman had a cropped haircut that shot upwards at the top, a light pink colour. She held her hands at her sides loose. She looked very young to be holding a weapon. 

"I'm Zelest ... Have you seen anyone else? Our captain's gone ... he's ... he's gone missing", asked the young woman in the spacesuit -- unsure of the question she seemed to be asking. 

"He's fine, he's just off comms." The slightly older man didn't sound very convinced. 

"Missing?" The Doctor repeated. "You're still pointing that gun Hando, are you going to shoot me?"

The man named Hando, in his faded orange spacesuit, looked at the budget pistol in his hand, noticed it for what seemed like the first time, cringed and dropped both arms to his side, deflated. 

"Missing for how long?" The Doctor was assertive now. No friendly sugar cup neighbour. 

"We don't-" 

Hando started to speak but Zelest standing next to him interrupted. "A few hours ago. He went to a restricted section to look for ... to explore, as soon as we got here." 

"Ah, I see". The Doctor shuffled nonchalantly, piecing things together, still on the precipice of the inky blackness. The light above them blinked more erratically now. The door the pair had come through closed with a subtle, but still quite audible, groan. The light went out. 

Desi felt her heart beat harder. There was another CLANG, quieter than the first, in the same direction as the darkness at the end of the corridor. The TARDIS was invisible, only handheld lights from Zelest and Hando, with Ambrose spinning round to move his wide beam at the noise's direction. The Doctor's shadow flickered across the wall as Ambrose turned, his face lit up momentarily. Desi saw the sharp, startled focus in his eyes. 

She stood in total darkness. The empty space around her in the corridor stranded her and the air was cold and dry and smelled ... 

The back of Desi's nose knew something that the rest of her didn't, it was shouting at her but she couldn't hear. Something old, and dry, ... but familiar? Something _very_ wrong. 

The corridor lit up with a stark red light. It seemed to come from everywhere immediately. A klaxon blared. 

"WARNING. DEPRESSURISATION. WARNING."

A dull, lifeless voice filled the corridor. It rammed into Desi's ears like an angry swarm. She couldn't see for it. Just red everywhere. 

She felt something grab her by the arm, pulled her forwards, she tried to keep her feet moving fast enough to keep up. A sliding shriek of metal happened and a wall appeared from above, hard edges bearing down. The blue of the TARDIS turned a dark shade of RED by the light, metal snapping down in front of it. 

"This way!" yelled a voice Desi's brain couldn't make out. Running and metal and alarms and _RED_. Desi tumbled through a doorway, pushed, falling against crates with hard edges. 

The noise stopped. She blinked, looked around. Yellow walls, faded paint, a small room, a bright, round light on the ceiling. The Doctor stood panting, his arm resting against the wall, doubled up. He had the sonic screwdriver in his other hand. A small metal door, round at the edges, closed with a keypad next to it. The woman in the spacesuit was in the room as well. 

The siren was still blaring through Desi's mind. She shut her eyes, put her hands over her ears, trying to block it out, but this sense memory kept flooding through her. 

* * * 

Hando stumbled through the dark corridor, alone, separated, disoriented. He tried to get his bearings, tried to reach Zelest on his communicator, reach Garrick ... reach Dad. 

He had to reach Dad. 

He could hear Dad's voice in his head. Calling him a muppet. Telling him he had "obvious things to learn". 

Hando reached the end of one section, heard the door ahead shunt and pop as the air equalised just as he reached it. It was like he was being ... helped? 

They had spent hours in the ship so far. Him and Zelest. Going round in circles. When they lost comm with Garrick they headed towards Corridor 9 in Section 5, where Garrick had gone first. They tried to, anyway. Every time they got through one door another closed behind them. The same codes worked once but failed a second time. The ship was haywire. 

Hando knew this was a lie he was telling himself. Deep down he'd known as soon as he stepped onto the derelict, sitting there in space, floating like a jewel, he'd known there was something seriously wrong about it. 

Another door opened as he reached it. Straight towards the restricted section. 

Need to reach Dad. 

* * * 

"Enough of this silly business, why are you here?"

The Doctor's voice was very, very far away from friendly sugar cup man now. 

Zelest in the room with the faded yellow paint looked at him looking at her, piercing her with his terrble gaze. 

"It's just my first ... I'm only here because ..."

Zelest felt silly and small. She glanced nervously at the kid, who was still covering her ears, crouched in the corner. 

"Garrick said it would be ..."

"And where is Garrick now?" The Doctor stood across the small supply cupboad, bearing down on her with his gaze. 

"We don't ... He went on ahead." Zelest fought back the stupid tears at the back of her eyes, scratching to get out. 

The Doctor's posture loosened. He looked ashamed suddenly. He turned his attention back to the door and the keypad. 

"I just wanted ... I just wanted to see what's out here." She felt ridiculous. 

She wanted to do something, see something, be someone more interesting than everyone else she knew back home. Not just ... comfortable. Now she was terrified. 

"Tell me everything that's happened so far." The Doctor was still facing the terminal with its keypad set into the wall, next to the only door in the small room stacked high with dirty metal crates. 

Zelest sat down. The crate was not comfortable to sit on. 

"As soon as we got here", she began, "the ship was acting ... weird. We had all the codes from its security core, but they kept changing. Doors opening or closing ... but it wasn't random, it felt ... " She trailed off, unsure of herself. 

The Doctor looked up, one hand holding whatever it was, a sonic tool or probe. She could feel he was silently encouraging her to continue. 

"It felt like we were being led." 

As she said it she felt the cold on her skin, felt it tighten under fear. 

"There is something here, something on this ship, watching us." The Doctor said it plainly, as one would explain the weather, or their preferred flavour of gastro-tonic to an auto-waiter. 

"It has control of the ship. We need to take it back."

* * * 

Hando trod carefully down the long, dark corridor, the ceiling above invisible, shrouded in darkness. Maybe there wasn't a ceiling, not even space and stars, just ... void. 

"Snap out of it", he heard himself say out loud in his father's voice. Corridor 9. He was here. 

A door with brightly coloured tape around the edges of its frame was open. Hando carefully stepped through. He was totally focused on the slightest hint of any noise around him. Any sign ... anything. His eyes blinked in the gloom. He couldn't see past his arm. 

Hando gripped his pistol so tightly he was scared he might break it. He'd never used it except once, out the airlock. He didn't even know if it still worked. 

The door behind him groaned and clicked shut. 

Hando reached out and felt the solid door, explored it in the darkness with his hand. No use. The keypad next to it was dead. 

The inky blackness grew closer around him, suffocating him. Panic starting to set in. 

Hando flicked the flashlight on. The metal bulkhead popped into existence in front of his head, closer than he thought. He turned, looked slowly around at the great cargo room, the ceiling disappearing farther than his torchlight dared to venture. The crates piled high, gantries disappearing upwards into gloom. 

In front of him, a low, gurgling sound. Hando stiffened, every inch of him listening, watching, waiting. 

In the middle of the room was ... 

He craned his neck forwards to see it...

* * * 

"We need a plan. The bridge. Have you located the bridge?"

The Doctor was totally absorbed by whatever he was doing with his device. Wearing a pair of glasses now, tapping the arms now and then with his other hand. His sonic device whirred and beeped. 

"No, we couldn't ... It was all locked, I tried to get us a workaround route, but the doors kept jamming. It isn't that far though, in theory."

Zelest felt the hard edge of the metal crate dig into the soft flesh of her thighs through her suit. She focused on it, tried not to think about anything else. 

"When this door opens", said the Doctor, "I don't know what will be on the other side."

The old man with his silver hair looked over at Zelest, lowered his glasses, peering over them. 

"Can you get us there?"

* * * 

"Dad?"

The gurgling noise weakly sputtered, bouncing off the edges of machinery and walls and containers in the enormous room. It sounded hollow, swallowed up and spat out. 

On a crate the size of a bed lay Garrick, lay Dad, dark red blood amongst bright medical-white tubes and twitching very slightly as he lay on the crate with tubes going to holes in his missing ... 

Hando couldn't look away. He was paralysed. An observer in his body. 

"Dad?" He whispered it. There was a hole in the side of Garrick's head. It was meticulously made, a master at surgery had-

`"Looks ... a bit like ... "`

The cold metallic voice behind Hando was dead and cold and it sounded like ...

`"Looks ... like a ..."`

Hando turned and saw it. 

`"Looks ... like a ... kidney"`

_metal and flesh and wrong, so wrong. it's moving, how is it moving? joints grinding, whining motors, sound like broken gears and snapped bone. fabric hanging tattered off chrome-plated limbs. that single hollow eye, looking at me. looking at me ... wires where veins should be. its head, oh god its head, its metal skull and patches of skin stretched too tight, peeling away, pulsing ... and fingers like scalpels, dripping with... is that blood? dad's blood? moving forwards with purpose and focus and each step determined and staring at me, bearing down at me ... dead rust and oil and the stench of ozone, the stench of bleach and flesh and blood and rot and death... patchwork bits and pieces all put together, wired together and welded and ... a voice, like gravel through a meat grinder in a dead machine. looking at me, staring at me, at me, coming closer ever second with its dead eye staring ..._

The nightmare kept coming, striding towards him. It had a limp. 

`"... Hando ..."`

Hando held out the pistol at the walking thing as it strode closer and closer to him out of the darkness and fired. The room lit up for a split second, the walking nightmare jerked back on one side, kept coming as he fired again and again, shots missed fired again and an enormous crate fell out from above and smashed into it as it screamed and Hando heard the bones crack. 

"Master Hando, sir. I think you should run", said the artificial voice of a floating butler robot above him. 

Hando slid on the wet floor as he turned and fell and the gun skidded across the floor and he picked it up with wet hands and ran. 

He ran and ran and ran.

...
